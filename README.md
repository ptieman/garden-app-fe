GROW SMART 

A garden planning application meant to creata a single source for gardeners to plan and prepare their gardens. 

STACK:
  Django
  React & Bootstrap


CURRENT FEATURES:
  Calendar
  Weather Widget
  Journal
  To-Do List
  Supplies List
  Seed List
  Plant library with Plant Hardiness Zone finder

For now, this is for my own personal use and is not set up for others to use/contribute to. My plans for this project in the future include:

  1. Calendar: being able to add tasks, show first & last frost dates for user based on hardiness zone
  2. To-Do List: assign due dates to task that connects with the calendar, being able to sort/categorize tasks 
  3. Seed List: Add in how many seeds are needed, a seed inventory tracker
  4. Weather: Automatically display weather instead of using input
  5. Plant Library: automatically display hardiness zone, and display the plant library based on hardiness zone
  6. Journal: be able to edit journal entries
